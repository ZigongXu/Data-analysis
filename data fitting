Data fitting basic:( mainly code and small tricks when apply. No need to google next time, lots of collection from Google results.


1. Most simple fitting
Using scipy.stats or np
here is example code:
from scipy import stats

m,b=np.polyfit(X, Y,1)
print(stats.linregress(X, Y))
# both above methods are ok.
plt.plot(xx, m*xx+b, ls='--')

2. ODR with error in both direction. see another file in this folder. Here give the code for application.
