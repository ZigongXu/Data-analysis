'''How to fit a model( e.g. a power law) to a data with errors in both x axis and y axis.'''

2. The standard deviation of energy bins
 2.1 Gaussion distribution in energy bins.
     The case of Gaussion distribution is large amount of particle lie in certain energy range.

     '''
      If a random variable X is normally distributed, about 68% of all values should lie within ±σ,
      approximately 95% of all data points should lie within ±2σ, and 99.7% should lie within ±3σ.
     ''' from Statistic P43
 2.2  Standard deviation of X and Y
      standard deviation(sigma, σ) is the value we need to give the Odr function(defination see 2.1). 
      In y axis, the sigma y is square root of counts if a statistical uncertainty.
      In X axis:
      Assuming the energy range is [E1,E2], then the equvilant energy is E =  sqrt(E1*E2). In loglog axis, the energy E is the 
   middel point of E1 and E2. Hencc,half of DE = log10(E2)-log10(E1) should be the width of this energy range. Generally, we would 
   use a energy range [E1,E2] to cover 95% of particles stopping in this channels. So, it would be ok that we use sigma(σ) = 
   1/2*[log10(E2)-log10(E1)]. But I would suggest it equal to 2sigma or 3sigma.
     If the equivilant E is E= (E1+E2)/2, then the sigma should be 1/2*(E2-E1).
